## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Implementation of the login and registration page. 
 Added search functionality

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One group member facced connection issues, and was forced to work around them by sending their changes using celluar data, from there the other group members were able to push the changes to a git hub branch to be merged.  
Working with the NY biodiversity database was tedious as queries had to be structured as SoQL calls, similar but not the same as SQL queries.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 All but one tasks in our sprint plan has been completed. This was a consequence of spending too long on implementing the search feature, which the aforementioned task was dependent on. Fortunately as the only remaining task of Sprint one, it will be the first issue tackled in Sprint 2 which is more focused on the user experience of the site.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The labs concerning user authentication and security tokens were extremely useful in implementing our own login and registration routes.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 At present no user story is "at risk." With about 40% of all user stories completed this project is on track to be completed by the end of Sprint 3.
